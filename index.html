						<p><b>About Tupac's "All Eyez On Me"</b></p>
						<p><b>Beginning</b>
							 - Tupac’s most memorable and impacting album to date is “All Eyez On Me”. 
							This album could be named as the greatest hip hop hit album ever. 
							It's a diamond certified, double
record album, with the perfect combination of hard in the yard in your face rap music and
more laid back and insightful songs.<br><br>
<b>Impact</b>
 - This album was created by Tupac when he was in jail, and released by Death Row
records. Tupac being in custody and still being able to touch the hearts of
everyone around America with his music brings so much meaning to the album. At the
time racism, poverty, and gang violence was a large issue in America and this album was
able to ball these problems up and roll out solutions, implying and emphasizing the issue
with the actions of others. “All Eyez On Me” also had many popular artists featured, such as
Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre, and Redman.<br><br>
<b>Effect</b>
 - The profound impact this album had in the hoods of America was astonishing. This
album not only talked on subjects about separate gangs and the violence between them
but it also brought people together. The songs about women’s rights shed more light and
awareness to single mothers in the hood. Tupac was able to talk about his own life
and struggles that he had. He brought awareness to what others were going through behind
closed doors. “All Eyez On Me” is one of the single most important albums ever
released, because of the impact and the story behind its origins.</p>
