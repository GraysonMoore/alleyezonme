						<p><b>About Tupac's "All Eyez On Me"</b></p>
						<p><b>Beginning</b>
							Tupac’s most memorable and impacting album to date is “All Eyes On Me”. 
							This album could be named as the greatest hip hop hit album ever. 
							This diamond certified, double
record album was the perfect combination of hard in the yard, in your face rap music and
more laid back and insightful songs.<br><br>
<b>Impact</b>
 - This album was created by Tupac as he was in jail, and released by Death Row
records. Tupac being in custody of the jail and still being able to touch the hearts of
everyone around America with his music brings so much meaning to the album. At the
time racism, poverty and gang violence was a large issue in America and this album was
able to ball these problems up and roll out solutions, implying and emphasizing the issue
with the actions of others. “All Eyes On Me” had many popular artists featured such as
Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre, and Redman just to name a few.<br><br>
<b>Effect</b>
 - The profound impact this album had in the hoods of America was astonishing. This
album not only talked on subjects about separate gangs and the violence between them
but it also brought people together. The songs about women’s rights shed more light and
awareness to single mothers in the hood. And Tupac being able to talk about his own life
and struggles that he has, bringing awareness to what others are going through behind
closed doors. “All Eyes On Me” is one of the single most important albums ever
released, because of the impact and the story behind it.</p>
