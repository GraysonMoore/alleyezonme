				worked to define the sound of West Coast hip-hop as a whole and inspire other 
				artiest and listeners. Being the first "double album" (collection of two records 
				or CDs sold as a single unit), this album set a new standard in terms of length 
				and lyrical content. The lyrics in songs from this album genereally explored 
				themes of poverty, injustice, and the realities of urban life. These ideas 
				intrigued peopel becuase some could relate to them heavily. These songs ad meaning

				to over 10 million copies of hte album being sold, it received a diamond 
				certification making it stand out even further. Despite its 1990s sound, the album's themes 
				and impact continue to resonate with fans and influence new generations of artists. Its 
				legacy has shaped some hip-hop fashion, music, and the overall culture of West
